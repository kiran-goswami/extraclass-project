    <h2 align="center"  style="color:tomato">love for nature</h2>
    <p>
        Nature is part of our life. We grew out of the seed, the earth, and we are part of all that, but we are rapidly
        losing the
        sense that we are animals like the others. Can you have a feeling for a tree, look at it, see the beauty of it,
        listen to the
        sound it makes? Can you be sensitive to the little plant, a little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall, to
        the light on
        the leaves and the many shadows? One must be aware of all this and have that sense of communion with nature
        around you. You may
        live in a town, but you do have trees here and there. A flower in the next garden may be ill-kept, crowded with
        weeds
        , but look at it, feel that you are part of all that, part of all living things. If you hurt nature, you are
        hurting yourself.
        <br>
        we sholud enjoy the charm of our nature.

    <h2  style="color:tomato">Things which are included in nature</h2>
    <p>There is a tree by the river, and we have been watching it day after day for several weeks when the sun is about
        to rise.
        As the sun rises slowly over the horizon, over the trees, this particular tree becomes all of a sudden golden.
        All the leaves
        are bright with life, and as you watch it as the hours pass by, that tree whose name does not matter—what
        matters is that beautiful
        tree—an extraordinary quality seems to spread all over the land, over the river. As the sun rises a little
        higher, the leaves begin
        to flutter, to dance. And each hour seems to give to that tree a different quality. Before the sun rises, it has
        a sombre feeling,
        quiet, far away, full of dignity. As the day begins, the leaves with the light on them dance and give it that
        peculiar feeling one
        has of great beauty. By midday, its shadow has deepened and you can sit there protected from the sun, never
        feeling lonely, with the
        tree as your companion. As you sit, there is a relationship of deep abiding security and a freedom that only
        trees can know. Towards
        the evening, when the western skies are lit up by the setting sun, the tree gradually becomes sombre, dark,
        closing in on itself. The sky has become red, yellow, green, but the tree remains quiet, hidden, and is resting
        for the night.</p>
    <p>love the mountains because they are beautiful. So many beautiful animals live in the mountains and from a
        distance the mountains look like shapes or animals. Wildlife. Our mountains protect our elegant trees.</p>
    Mountains have provided refuge to truth-seekers, hermits and even to ordinary men. With their beauty, mystery and
    transcendence, they can help lift our lives above the grime and dirt associated with the plains below. Till today,
    to conquer a mountain is seen as a human and spiritual feat
    <h3  style="color:tomato">Gifts given by nature to us</h3>
    <p>we should protect our nature to feel the beauty
        our nature is so colourfull and beneficial for us .
        its god gifted and we should respect that because trees provides oxygen to us.
        river provide water for us ,soil provides crops and many more we cant even have a chance to live without them
        and as the quote says our nature is that we borrowed it from our childres we should conserve it for them
        so that they can live their lives in fresh air and burden free life.
